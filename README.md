# Othello

## Rules
The basic play of the game Othello is to place your colour of disc next to a disc of your next to a disc of your opponent's colour in anycontiguous line of discs (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) which contains another disc of your colour. Then, youcan flip the colour of every disk along any contiguous line of discs between your just-placed disc and anotherdisc of your colour. The complete rules are provided in the file "Othello Rules.pdf".The starting configuration of the board and its display using text on the console are shown below.The main differences are that I used "O" for white and "X" for black and that the rows and columns of theboard are labelled. This is so the players can enter a simple row-column code like 'fd' to place a disc in thecell at row 'f' and column 'd' (a valid move for white here).
